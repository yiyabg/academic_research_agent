/**
 * Pretty-print a single-line SQL statement onto multiple lines so it reads like a
 * formatted code block instead of one long string. Major clauses start a new line
 * and boolean connectors in the WHERE clause are indented.
 *
 * String literals are masked with a `{{LITn}}` token before the newline pass and
 * restored afterwards. The token carries no whitespace and no bare digits of its own,
 * so a keyword inside quotes (e.g. an ILIKE pattern) is never broken onto a new line,
 * and a real number such as `LIMIT 20` is never mistaken for a masked literal. A SQL
 * string that already contains newlines is assumed pre-formatted and returned as-is.
